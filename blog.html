				<p>A lot has happened, and I'm sorry for not staying updated!</p>
				<p>I've gotten into the Master's in Science in Applied Analytics at Columbia's School of Professional Studies. I'm hoping to take advantage of this as a new start.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, my family traveled to Paris and Barcelona over the winter break. I loved all the museums!</p>

				<p><i>Below the Edge of Darkness</i> by Edith Widder, Ph.D. <img src="./images/darkness.jpg" width="50" alt="cover of below the edge of darkness by edith widder phd"/></p>
				<p>I loved this! The author did a great job of telling the story in an engaging and personable way while including a lot of scientific information. I'm surprised she found difficulty with it,
					but then again having a personable tone over text is something I struggle with a lot myself. I'm definitely inspired by this book to do more research on the subjects touched upon, especially in
					the author's scientific publishings.
				</p>
				<p>Additional news: I passed my AWS Cloud Practictioner Exam! I've done a lot recently--started my Data Analytics Certificate at COD, got a retail job, applied to jobs and grad programs--but I'm still
					looking to be pretty busy this semester, continuing my applications and taking the GRE Physics exam in November. I just hope I can keep up with everything as well as what I want to do in my free time
				(I miss D&D a lot and want to get back into it)...but it's nice to be busy!</p>

				<p><i>The Bathysphere Book</i> by Brad Fox <img src="./images/bathysphere.jpg" width="50" alt="cover of the bathysphere book by brad fox"/></p>
				<p>Pretty unconventional for nonfiction, rather than a collection of factual stories it's much more a scrapbook of musings and thoughts mixed with the events. I enjoyed it, but I think I 
					might prefer the "traditional" nonfiction format. To this day my favorite nonfiction book is Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann. I highly recommend the novel, but haven't watched the film.

				afterwards. It was great getting to participate in the Galaxy Zoo project and talk to an actual postgraduate in astronomy regarding research in exoplanets. Highly recommend seeing a show in the sky 
				theater when visiting.

			<p>One great experience with them has been driving south to see the eclipse! My phone camera was ill-equipped, but I still managed to captured a bit of a shadow on the sun. 
				It was truly a breathtaking experience, seeing the sky go dark and hearing the birds go silent when it suddenly became night, just for a little bit.
				If you ever have the opportunity to experience it in person, I can corroborate the many stories that it is truly different from seeing pictures.

				<p>I had a fantastic time volunteering at the Field Museum today, because the guest scientist was an astrochemist/geologist specializing in meteorites, 
					and brought a few specimens out to show to visitors.</p>
				<p>With that, I will give a very non-in-depth overview of how to identify a meteorite, in case you ever find one of your own!*</p>
				<p>*Check your local laws on meteorites. Some governments label them as property of the state.</p>
				<img src="./images/meteorite6.jpg" width="500"/><img src="./images/meteorite9.jpg" width="500"/>
				<p>Rather than chunks of concrete, these are young meteorites. Note the perfectly circular inclusions.</p>
				<img src="./images/meteorite7.jpg" width="500"/><img src="./images/meteorite8.jpg" width="500"/>
				<p>Not even volcanic rocks from Earth would have this scorched crust.</p>
				<img src="./images/meteorite2.jpg" width="500"/><img src="./images/meteorite4.jpg" width="500"/>
				<p>The outer layers of these older meteorites have been completely burned away, leaving only the metal core. In fact, planets are just very large meteorites.
					The pattern on the left slice is the result of treatment.
					If you were an ancient blacksmith, you would be quite happy to be given something like the right to work with.</p>
				<img src="./images/meteorite1.jpg" width="500"/><img src="./images/meteorite3.jpg" width="500"/>
				<p>The pallsite on the left has been polished to a mirror sheen. The crystals are iron-based, hence their rust.
					The right is an extremely interesting specimen of a fossilized meteorite approximately 4.6 billion years old given the prehistoric squid fossil next to it.

				<p>Book review: <i>Princess Floralinda and the Forty-Flight Tower</i> by Tamsyn Muir <img src="./images/floralinda.jpg" width="50" alt="cover of princess floralinda and the forty-flight tower book by tamsyn muir"/></p>
				<p>A short book that plays with the archtypical damsel-in-distress from fairytales. 
					Like many of the fairytale subversions I enjoy, it does a great job of playfully poking fun at the usual triteness of the genre while acknowledging and riffing on some of its unexpected truths.
					Especially interesting in the context of the course of fairy tales I am currently taking. 
					The story itself tends to touch on serious themes and ideas and only dives into one major one that interlinks with those mentioned, but it does it well especially given its length.
					A great quick read, I would recommend it for maybe a teenager willing to entertain the premise or of course a more playful adult with an interest.

				<p>Book review: <i>The Beast You Are</i> by Paul Tremblay</p>
				<p>Another anthology! I picked this up for a fitting read during the Halloween season. I enjoyed most of the stories besides the ones involving a particular meta presentation;
					maybe I've watched too much analog horror that I don't really "get" smart twists in those kinds of stories anymore. I might have to look online for interpretations.
					Regardless, I will say the titular story, The Beast You Are, was my favorite in concept and formatting; talking animals in an unexpectedly serious and "adult" story are a classic.
					I also liked Red Eyes; it reminded me of way back when sixpenceee on tumblr had her scary story forum. Unfortunately it seems completely lost to the internet now, 
					but I remember enough about "Give Me Gifts" that I can probably rewrite it. I wonder if the author posted it anywhere else.

				<p>Book review: <i>The Confidence Game</i> by Maria Konnikova</p>
				<p>
					I enjoyed this a lot! It was very interesting to learn about some of the common logical fallacies people fall into in daily life, and how they can be exploited. 
					I do feel like the delineation between steps of the con got muddled sometimes, and that the examples chosen weren't exact one-to-one demonstrations of those steps.
					However, it was especially enlightening reading it while playing as and with changelings in a D&D campaign. Maybe that's not the intended use of this book.
					Anyways, I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic, people who have fallen victim to scams and cons (the book emphasizes frequently that it's rarely your fault), 
					and people who have never or think they'd never get caught up in something like that. I already knew the disclaimer that even smart people can be suckered, 
					but never before have I noticed the flaws in my own mentality so keenly. I'm not sure if I'll be able to consciously correct them, but it was a great read!

				<p> <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/">Emily Bender</a> regarding ChatGPT</p>
				<p>With all the buzz about AI recently, it was nice to have some actual insight on its uses and philisophical implications!</p>
				<p>I enjoyed talking to my new friend group (if I had a nickel for every time my D&D group became an actual friend group, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's great it happened twice.) 
					afterwards about stochastic parrots. If only everybody could be levelheaded and reasonable about new technology! I really don't understand the rush to make news AI-generated, 
					especially with all the demonstrations of how easy it is to trick the system.
				</p>
				<p>I guess I should take some time during break to learn how to use ChatGPT, or maybe talk to some Character AIs. Apparently my brother has made a hobby out of breaking them.</p>
				<p><a href="https://statquest.org/">Josh Starmer</a> on Job Security</p>
				<p>This was insightful and made me consider some things about how to work with others in research in the future. It'd be a bit of a struggle with how reticent I am, but I'm sure I can make it work.</p>

				<p>Book review: <i>Tao Te Ching</i> by Lao Tzu, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
				<p>While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to find a copy of the translation I was looking for, I enjoyed Le Guin's commentary! 
					However, I tried to not read too much into it and come up with my own interpretations of the text. 
					I jumped around in the text based on what themes I thought were relevant for the day. Of course, the Taoteching still has  a lot of insight worth pondering over in the modern age. 
					I'd recommend it, if only to have in mind for how society functions. It's a lot about going with the flow and accepting things as they are, 
					which is good to think about during stressful times in life. While not applicable to everything, I do think my state of mind has improved having read it.
					As for which translation is best, I'd have to read more translations!

				<p>Book review: <i>Gory Details</i> by Erika Engelhaupt</p>
				<p>I enjoyed this book a lot! As I've gotten older and more busy I appreciate books with more episodic concepts that are easy to put down and pick back up, 
					and the focus on a new story each time was engaging. I enjoyed the tieback of every story at the epilogue where the purpose of studying and cataloguing these discoveries 
					was acknowledged as necessary for people to learn and have a healthier attitude towards the world around us and ourselves.
					Overall, highly recommend if you aren't squeamish and are interested in more bizarre scientific discoveries being made, or if you are squeamish and want to build your tolerance. 
					There are no images and descriptions are kept fairly brief, but there are more detailed drawings to section off the book.
