				<p>Long time no see! Happy holidays!</p>
				<p>I got caught up in finals and applying to graduate school, but I'm pretty satisfied with how its gone so far.</p>
				<p>I volunteered at the Field Museum again and took another pass through the First Kings of Europe exhibit. 
					I did find in more engaging the second time around, but the consensus seems to be mixed on it in general. Too bad I can't find the books about the exhibit online...</p>

				<p>I hope everyone has a relaxing fall break/Thanksgiving! I went to my brother's orchestra concert on Sunday. 
					I always enjoy the Carmen suites, even if one in particular has been colored by a certain game series.
				</p>
				<p>Speaking of, I enjoyed the movie, very much for fans by fans, and the production was impressive. There are some very interesting theories floating around, I recommend it for all fans of the series.</p>
				<p>I also went to volunteer at the Field Museum and see the new Bloodsuckers exhibit. Once again I recommend it! It begins with medical and biological explanations of how bloodfeeders function,
					then goes into the cultural history of vampires and mythological beings that subsist off of blood, up to the modern day, 
					and finally speaks on the medical role of bloodsuckers historically and now (namely leeches!).

				<p>Book review: <i>The Beast You Are</i> by Paul Tremblay</p>
				<p>Another anthology! I picked this up for a fitting read during the Halloween season. I enjoyed most of the stories besides the ones involving a particular meta presentation;
					maybe I've watched too much analog horror that I don't really "get" smart twists in those kinds of stories anymore. I might have to look online for interpretations.
					Regardless, I will say the titular story, The Beast You Are, was my favorite in concept and formatting; talking animals in an unexpectedly serious and "adult" story are a classic.
					I also liked Red Eyes; it reminded me of way back when sixpenceee on tumblr had her scary story forum. Unfortunately it seems completely lost to the internet now, 
					but I remember enough about "Give Me Gifts" that I can probably rewrite it. I wonder if the author posted it anywhere else.

				<p>Observing season is over at the University! It's too cold for that now. Unfortunately I was only able to assist at one session as part of my work as a grader/tutor at the Astronomy department,
					but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
				</p>
				<p>We were once again able to see the Summer Triangle. The most notable object was Saturn to the east, and Jupiter came up later in the night.</p>

				<p>Book review: <i>The Confidence Game</i> by Maria Konnikova</p>
				<p>
					I enjoyed this a lot! It was very interesting to learn about some of the common logical fallacies people fall into in daily life, and how they can be exploited. 
					I do feel like the delineation between steps of the con got muddled sometimes, and that the examples chosen weren't exact one-to-one demonstrations of those steps.
					However, it was especially enlightening reading it while playing as and with changelings in a D&D campaign. Maybe that's not the intended use of this book.
					Anyways, I recommend it for anyone interested in the topic, people who have fallen victim to scams and cons (the book emphasizes frequently that it's rarely your fault), 
					and people who have never or think they'd never get caught up in something like that. I already knew the disclaimer that even smart people can be suckered, 
					but never before have I noticed the flaws in my own mentality so keenly. I'm not sure if I'll be able to consciously correct them, but it was a great read!
				</p>
				<p>Looking forward to: My childhood friend/roommate's birthday!</p>

			<h3>
				<p>I went to a couple of the Reflections|Projects seminars hosted by the CS department. 
					I'd say the ones most intriguing to me were:
				</p>
				<p> <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/">Emily Bender</a> regarding ChatGPT</p>
				<p>With all the buzz about AI recently, it was nice to have some actual insight on its uses and philisophical implications!</p>
				<p>I enjoyed talking to my new friend group (if I had a nickel for every time my D&D group became an actual friend group, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's great it happened twice.) 
					afterwards about stochastic parrots. If only everybody could be levelheaded and reasonable about new technology! I really don't understand the rush to make news AI-generated, 
					especially with all the demonstrations of how easy it is to trick the system.
				</p>
				<p>I guess I should take some time during break to learn how to use ChatGPT, or maybe talk to some Character AIs. Apparently my brother has made a hobby out of breaking them.</p>
				<p><a href="https://statquest.org/">Josh Starmer</a> on Job Security</p>
				<p>This was insightful and made me consider some things about how to work with others in research in the future. It'd be a bit of a struggle with how reticent I am, but I'm sure I can make it work.</p>

				<p>Book review: <i>Tao Te Ching</i> by Lao Tzu, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
				<p>While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to find a copy of the translation I was looking for, I enjoyed Le Guin's commentary! 
					However, I tried to not read too much into it and come up with my own interpretations of the text. 
					I jumped around in the text based on what themes I thought were relevant for the day. Of course, the Taoteching still has  a lot of insight worth pondering over in the modern age. 
					I'd recommend it, if only to have in mind for how society functions. It's a lot about going with the flow and accepting things as they are, 
					which is good to think about during stressful times in life. While not applicable to everything, I do think my state of mind has improved having read it.
					As for which translation is best, I'd have to read more translations!

				<p>Long time no blog! I'm entering my last year of my bachelor's degree, so I've been preoccupied. I've decided to make things a little easier on myself and commit to posting every other week.</p>
				<p>With that being said, school has started! I like my professors and my courses so far.</p>
				<p>I'm also participating in two D&D campaigns, but the characters I'm playing are part of the same family.</p>
				<p>A quote from a friend: "Gee, I wonder why this campaign about a reality-bending theater troupe has so many changeling bards."</p>
				<p>Looking forward to: Learning more about galaxies and forensic science</p>

				<p>Yesterday my family tried to spend some time stargazing as best we could in the suburbs. It was a little hard to make out, but I believe we may have seen the Summer Triangle. </p>
				<p>Here's a photo taken with my phone and edited by me.</p>
				<img src="./images/triangle.jpg" width="500" alt="image of summer triangle stars deneb vega altair"/>
				<p>Two of these stars, Vega and Altair, are the main characters of a significant legend and ancient holiday in China, the 7th day of the 7th lunar month known as Qixi, or "Chinese Valentine's Day".</p>
				<p>You can read a fairly comprehensive account of the story <a href="https://martinifisher.com/2021/11/25/the-legend-of-the-cowherd-and-the-weaver-girl/">here.</a></p>

				<p>Book review: <i>Gory Details</i> by Erika Engelhaupt</p>
				<p>I enjoyed this book a lot! As I've gotten older and more busy I appreciate books with more episodic concepts that are easy to put down and pick back up, 
					and the focus on a new story each time was engaging. I enjoyed the tieback of every story at the epilogue where the purpose of studying and cataloguing these discoveries 
					was acknowledged as necessary for people to learn and have a healthier attitude towards the world around us and ourselves.
					Overall, highly recommend if you aren't squeamish and are interested in more bizarre scientific discoveries being made, or if you are squeamish and want to build your tolerance. 
					There are no images and descriptions are kept fairly brief, but there are more detailed drawings to section off the book.
				</p>
				<p>Recent events: I went to volunteer at the Chicago Field Museum. There is an ongoing vote to name the new Spinosaurus display <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/lets-name-our-new-spinosaurus">here.</a> I picked Sobek.</p>
				<p>Something I learned this week: <a href="https://youtu.be/A5Rzx7yeh7c">Platypuses lack a certain organ...</a></p>
