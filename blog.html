				<p>Book review: <i>Gory Details</i> by Erika Engelhaupt</p>
				<p>I enjoyed this book a lot. As I've gotten older and more busy I appreciate books with more episodic concepts that are easy to put down and pick back up, 
					and the focus on a new story each time was engaging. I enjoyed the tieback of every story at the epilogue where the purpose of studying and cataloguing these discoveries 
					was acknowledged as necessary for people to learn and have a healthier attitude towards the world around us and ourselves.
					Overall, highly recommend if you aren't squeamish and are interested in more bizarre scientific discoveries being made, or if you are squeamish and want to build your tolerance. 
					There are no images and descriptions are kept fairly brief, but there are more detailed drawings to section off the book.</p>
				<p>Recent events: I went to volunteer at the Chicago Field Museum. There is an ongoing vote to name the new Spinosaurus display <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/lets-name-our-new-spinosaurus">here.</a> I picked Sobek.</p>
				<p>Something I learned this week: <a href="https://youtu.be/A5Rzx7yeh7c">Platypuses don't have stomachs.</a></p>

				<p>Hobbies: D&D, video games, drawing</p>
				<p>Looking forward to: being on campus with my friends, playing D&D, working for the astronomy department, forensic science course, <br />Weather Factory's <i>Book of Hours</i>, <i>Genshin Impact</i> Fontaine release</p>
				<p>Worried about: physics course (electromagnetics), getting enough exercise</p>
				<p>Focusing on: personal statement, drawing D&D characters</p>
