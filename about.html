                <p>I am currently a rising senior at UIUC majoring in Astronomy with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>
                    I find astronomy very engaging as a field with a very long history intertwined with mythology and yet with new discoveries all the time.
                    <br />I'm looking to apply to graduate school for a PhD in Astronomy this Fall.
                </p>
                <p>My interests are in planet and galaxy formation and computer science applications to astronomy such as simulations and software.</p>
                <p>My skills include coding knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, JSON, and C++.</p>
                <p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese and at an intermediate level in German.</p>
